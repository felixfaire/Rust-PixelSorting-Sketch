# Rust-PixelSorting-Sketch

A mini project to begin learning Rust. Very rough around the edges. Welcoming constructive feedback.

The command line application uses the [image](https://docs.rs/image/0.23.12/image/) crate to perform some datamoshing pixel operations on an image file input, inspired by [Kim Asendorf](http://kimasendorf.com/)'s popular technique.
